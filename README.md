# TDD Clean Architecture for Flutter (2024.06)

The learning project I made from a [Resco Coder tutorial series](https://resocoder.com/flutter-clean-architecture-tdd/).
I used [null safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety), [mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) instead of [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito), [bloc_test](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc_test) and the newest packages for May/June 2024.
